Extension Attempted/extra additions
- Zooming is animated and the Julia display is updated in real time as the user moves the mouse over the main display.
- The user is able to select different fractal sets to display. Fractals included are the Mandelbrot, Burning Ship, Triplebrot (a multibrot) and the Bird of Prey
- Various orbit trap styles have been implemented with a region split that uses three colors. Both the Main fractal and the Julia have orbit traps implemented.
- A smooth colouring algorithm is used for non orbit trap colouring, RGB sliders may be used to set the base color to any color on the RGB scale. A smooth gradient is then 
calculated from the chosen color. The brightness of the fractal may also be increased if a dark colour is chosen. These options are not available when using orbit traps.

User Guide:
- Settings (aside from the bounds of the complex plane) are shared between the main fractal and julia display. Changed settings will be instantly applied to the live Julia set.
The main fractal display will only update with the changed settings when the "generate main fractal set" button is pressed.
- Users may click on points to save the fractal that is generated by that complex point. This point is seperate to the point used for live updating so can be used
to favorite a julia set. When loading a saved julia set, any settings may be applied to it, whilst keeping the same complex point. saved julias may be saved as an image file.
- Color settings are disabled with orbit traps activated. The colors used are always the same for these.
